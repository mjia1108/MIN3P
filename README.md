**Introduction**: 

MIN3P is a general purpose flow and reactive transport code for variably saturated media providing a high degree of flexibility with respect to the definition of the reaction network. Advective-diffusive transport in the water phase and diffusive transport in the gas phase are included.  Equilibrium reactions considered are aqueous complexation, gas partitioning between phases, oxidation-reduction, ion exchange, and surface complexation. The reaction network is designed to handle kinetically controlled intra-aqueous and dissolution-precipitation reactions, and the dissolution of non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). All reactions can be defined through a database, not requiring external code generation by the user.

**Application**: 

Subsurface fluid migration and geochemical conditions may be impacted by a variety of interacting physical and chemical processes, including density-dependent, variably-saturated groundwater flow, heat transport, mass transport, mixing of waters of different geochemical compositions, water-rock interaction, and mechanical loading. Understanding the interactions among these processes is important when investigating contaminant migration in groundwater, natural attenuation processes, or site remediation alternatives, and when assessing the long-term hydrogeological and geochemical stability of rock formations. MIN3P is a three-dimensional (3D) numerical model that has been developed to simulate the processes that are most relevant to these types of subsurface flow and reactive transport problems, and is primarily used to aid in the quantitative assessment of laboratory experiments and field studies. For examples and verification studies, refer to the Verification Examples.
